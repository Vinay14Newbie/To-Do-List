- why to use key while looping

when you don't use keys, React might get confused and lose track of which items are which, leading to inefficient rendering and potential bugs.
Keys helps React optimize re-rendering and improve performance by only updating what's necessary.
key of Virtual DOM will be different for every item & it matches with it



How it re-render things if some update happens 
we're using state and when state changes the React will automatically render the things, here we're using keys to avoid re-rendering of same items
